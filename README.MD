# Disable Custom Worlds Advice
![Download count](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/401978.svg) ![Compatible versions](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/versions/401978.svg)

This simple mod disables the annoying "Experimental Features" advice that appears every time you create or load a world with custom dimensions or world settings. You can use it if either this screen annoys you as much as it does to me or you are creating a mod with custom worldgen and you want to disable the advice screen (Jar-in-jar if that's your case!).
